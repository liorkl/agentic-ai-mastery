## Getting Started

If this is your first time, start with `/coach:assess` to scan your environment and determine your current skill level.

## How It Works

The coach scans your Claude Code configuration (CLAUDE.md, .claude/ directory, settings, and more) to detect your current skill level on an 11-level scale (L0–L10). It then delivers targeted coaching, identifies gaps in your setup, flags anti-patterns, and tracks your progress over time.

The coaching skill also activates automatically when you ask learning-related questions — no command needed.
